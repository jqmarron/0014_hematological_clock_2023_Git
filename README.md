<h3> Abstract </h3>

This study proposes a biological clock for mice utilizing routinely collected hematological markers (eight hematological variables and two metabolic indices).
Leveraging over 12,000 observations from 2,500+ mice of various strains and both sexes, a deep neural network was trained and validated to predict age, assess aging acceleration, and unveil its clinical implications on mortality and frailty.
